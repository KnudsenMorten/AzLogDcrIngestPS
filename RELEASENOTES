RELEASE NOTES

v1.4.4   Check for - (hyphen) in column names has been added, as it is now prohibited. Table name check now looks for prohibited names like - (hypen), . (period), whitespace

v1.4.0   Support for migration from HTTP Data Collector API to Log Ingestion API

V1.3.0   Minor changes. Decided to change to v1.3, as we had 39 minor version changes under v1.2.xx

v1.2.39  Removed so script will only change schema if name is not found - not if property type is different (who wins?)

v1.2.38  Changed the logic around SchemaMode = Merge, so the schema in DCR will be based on LogAnalytics table schema - and not the source object schema. 

v1.2.37  Adding another check to SchemaMode = Merge, so it will support existing properties are changing type

v1.2.36  Bugfix

v1.2.35  Changing so $AzDcrLogIngestServicePrincipalObjectId is not a mandatory parameter

v1.2.34  Bugfix - schemamode = merge wasn't updating table correctly

v1.2.33  Bugfix - signature was by mistake in source file (removed)

v1.2.32  Bugfix - skip TimeGenerated in DCR table schema when doing a merge. TimeGenerated only exist in table, not DCR

v1.2.31  Added parameter SchemaMode = Merge/Overwrite for functions CheckCreateUpdate-TableDcr-Structure, CreateUpdate-AzLogAnalyticsCustomLogTableDcr, CreateUpdate-AzDataCollectionRuleLogIngestCustomLog
			SchemaMode = Merge (default)
			It will do a merge/union of new properties and existing schema properties. DCR will import schema from table

			SchemaMode = Overwrite
			It will overwrite existing schema in DCR/table â€“ based on source object schema
			This parameter can be useful for separate overflow work
	
		 Signing of PSM1 and PS1-files is changed from SHA1 to SHA256

v1.2.30  Added new function Get-AzDataCollectionRuleTransformKql. 
			Can be used to retrieve the current transforKql parameter

v1.0.00  Initial version
